# deep-learning-specialization
* This is my assignment on Andrew Ng's special course  "[***Deep Learning Specialization***](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)" This special course consists of five courses: 
    * [***Neural Networks and Deep Learning***](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/welcome)  
    * [***Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization***](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/home/welcome) 
    * [***Structuring Machine Learning Projects***](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/home/welcome)
    * [***Convolutional Neural Networks***](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks)
    * [***Sequence Models***](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models)
    
* [***Neural Networks and Deep Learning***](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/welcome)
    * In this course, you will learn the foundations of deep learning. When you finish this class, you will:
        * Understand the major technology trends driving Deep Learning
        * Be able to build, train and apply fully connected deep neural networks 
        * Know how to implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks 
        * Understand the key parameters in a neural network's architecture 
      
    * This course also teaches you how Deep Learning actually works, rather than presenting only a cursory or surface-level description. So after completing it, you will be able to apply deep learning to a your own applications. If you are looking for a job in AI, after this course you will also be able to answer basic interview questions.
